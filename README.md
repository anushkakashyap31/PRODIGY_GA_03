🚀 PRODIGY_GA_03 — Markov Chain Text Generation

This repository contains Task 3: Markov Chain Text Generation Project as part of my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy Infotech, where I built a text generator using Markov Chains based on a given text input.

💡 Project Overview

In this task, I have:

Implemented a Markov Chain-based text generator from scratch using Python.

Taken an input text file and generated random text that mimics the style of the original input.

Allowed dynamic input of order for the Markov Chain model.

Performed text cleaning, mapping of prefixes to suffixes, and generated new sequences.

📄 Files Included

markov_text_generator.py: Main Python script for building and generating text using a Markov Chain.

input.txt: Text file used as the base input for generating new text.

output.txt: Generated output saved in this file.

.gitignore: To exclude unnecessary files/folders.

README.md: You are here!

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.9+

VSCode

Basic File I/O

Dictionaries and Lists

Random Module

✅ How to Use

1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/anushkakashyap31/PRODIGY_GA_03
cd PRODIGY_GA_03

2️⃣ Ensure input.txt contains the source text

You can modify input.txt with your own large text data (novels, articles, etc.).

python markov_generator.py

4️⃣ Follow prompts:

Enter the desired order (e.g., 2, 3, or 4) when asked.

The script will generate random text based on the input file and print it as well as you will save it in output.txt.

📌 Example

If your input.txt contains:

"I love learning AI. AI is the future of technology."

And your order is 2, the generated output might look like:

"AI is the future of technology. AI is the future..."

🎯 Objectives

Understand the concept of Markov Chains in text generation.

Implement text mapping and transition logic.

Gain practical experience with randomness and sequences.
